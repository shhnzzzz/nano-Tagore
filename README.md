# nano-Tagore   
This project trains a GPT-style character-level language model on the poems and songs of Rabindranath Tagore, inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT). Our goal is to generate Tagore-style poetry using a minimal transformer-based architecture.


## Key Features 

Train a GPT-style Language Model on Rabindranath Tagore’s Works -
Fine-tune a character-level or token-level transformer model using Tagore’s poems and songs to generate stylistically similar text.

Minimal and Readable Transformer Implementation -
Built upon Andrej Karpathy’s NanoGPT, this project retains a clean and modular codebase ideal for understanding, experimentation, and customization.
